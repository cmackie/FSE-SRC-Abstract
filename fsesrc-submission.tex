\section{Problem and Motivation}

Signed integers use the first bit of the machine representation to
represent the sign of a value.  Unsigned integers use all
bits of the machine representation to represent the magnitude of a value allowing them to
represent a larger range of positive numbers than signed integers at the cost of
representing negative numbers.
Unsigned integers are useful, so many programming languages support them;
for example, Java 8 provides utility methods for unsigned
integers~\cite{JDK8UnsignedIntegerArithmetic2012}.  However, they are also
error-prone; using an unsigned integer where a signed
one is expected, or performing certain arithmetic operations and
comparisons on unsigned integers, can lead to unexpected results.

We call an operator ``insensitive'' if it produces a correct signed result
when run on two signed values and a correct unsigned result
when run on two unsigned values. Conversely, we call an operator ``sensitive'' if it
produces incorrect results when run on two unsigned values.  For such
operations, a programmer must run a different implementation depending on whether
the operands are signed or unsigned.  See Figure~\ref{fig:operators} for
an example of insensitive and sensitive operators.

Misuse of unsigned values can be categorized as follows:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item Using a sensitive operator with operands of opposite signedness to the implementation of the operator.
  \item Mixing signed and unsigned arguments to any operator, sensitive or insensitive.
\end{itemize}

The first line of defense against most bugs is the compiler. When the
compiler is unable to catch bugs it falls on the programmer to identify and
eliminate them, which is prone to human error. The Java compiler
is not helpful in finding bugs related to using unsigned
numbers because Java's unsigned
integers are supported by a library rather than built into Java.


\section{Approach and Uniqueness}

Our approach to detecting and preventing signedness errors is to use a type
system. This has a number of benefits.
%
Compile-time checking permits developers
to catch bugs before they become problems for their end-users.
%
Type systems are familiar to programmers, who understand how to use them
and how to interpret their warning messages.

byte x = 0xFF; // Signed -1, Unsigned 255
byte y = 0xFE; // Signed -2, Unsigned 254

byte sub = x - y;
// Result is 1, which is correct when:
//  * x, y, and sub are signed.
//  * x, y, and sub are unsigned.

byte div = y / x;
// Result is 2.
//  * Correct for signed x, y, and div.
//  * Incorrect for unsigned x, y, and div.

We have defined a signedness type system with five type qualifiers
(Figure~\ref{fig:type-hierarchy}).  Each type qualifier is written together
with a base type; for example, \<@Unsigned int i> declares a
variable named \<i> of type \<@Unsigned int>.

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item \<@UnknownSignedness> indicates a value for which the
    Signedness Checker has no estimate.  (This usually leads to a
    type-checking warning.)  It is also used for non-numeric
    values, which the Signedness Checker ignores.
  \item \<@Unsigned> and \<@Signed> signify a value's signedness.
  \item \<@Constant> is for values known at compile time, such as
    manifest literals in the source code.  The programmer might intend to
    use them as signed or as unsigned values.  Even a negative literal may
    be used as a convenience placeholder for a large positive unsigned
    integer.
  \item \<@SignednessBottom> indicates dead code or the \<null> value.
\end{itemize}

The programmer writes \<@Unsigned> type qualifiers within field and method
declarations in the program's source code.  Unannotated Java types within
field and method signatures are given a default qualifier.  More
specifically, here are the type introduction rules of our type system:

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item If the user wrote a type qualifier, use it.
  \item If an integral expression is a constant at compile time, use
    \<@Constant>.
    Integral types are \<char>, \<byte>, \<short>, \<int>, \<long>, \<Integer>, and \<Long>.
  \item Other integral expressions use \<@Signed>.
  \item Other non-integral expressions use the top type, \<@UnknownSignedness>.
\end{enumerate}

The type rules of the signedness type system issue a warning if a program
might perform a computation using operands of incorrect or mixed signedness.
These type rules are as follows:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item Unsigned values may not be used as operands for sensitive
    operators.
  \item With the exception of shifts, no operator may operate on a mix of
    signed and unsigned values.
  \item Logical right shifts may only be applied to unsigned values.
  \item Arithmetic right shifts may only be applied to signed values.
\end{itemize}

An insensitive operator is allowed to be used on either signed or unsigned
values, so long as all the operands are of the same type.  In general, an operator's
result type is the least upper bound of its argument types.

\section{Background and Implementation}

Our goal is to build a verification tool that guarantees that software is
free of bugs related to unsigned integers. To achieve this, our approach
must be sound:  if it issues no warnings, then the program must be free of
bugs.
This means that the tool may issue false positive alarms:  warnings about
code that will not actually go wrong at run time.  This occurs when the
Signedness Checker cannot prove that the code is correct. See Figure~\ref{fig:false-alarm}
for an example of code for which the Signedness Checker may issue a false alarm.

We built our Signedness Checker implementation using the
Checker Framework~\cite{PapiACPE2008,DietlDEMS2011}, which enables the
construction of pluggable type systems for Java.
The Signedness Checker is distributed as part of the Checker Framework
\url{http://CheckerFramework.org/}, starting with version 2.1.0.

Our pluggable type system implementaion consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item Type qualifiers are implemented declaratively as Java 8 type
    annotations~\cite{JSR308-PFD}.
  \item Type indroduction rules are defined procedurally.
  \item Type rules are enforced by a traversal of the syntax tree.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Contributions}

We evaluated the Signedness Checker by running it on jake2, a Java
port of the popular '90s video game, Quake II\@.  The original C
implementation of Quake II used unsigned integers. jake2
tries to mimic Quake II's usage and consists of 133513 lines of code that
can be found at \url{https://github.com/mbien/jake2}.
We wrote 33 annotations, referring to the
C implementation when we had questions about the Java developers' intent.

The largest inconsistency between the C and Java implementations is that
jake2 uses logical right shift operations
in many locations where the C implementation used arithmetic right shift
operations.  The Signedness Checker identified these for us.
In some cases, either shift operation is correct because both have the same
effect.  An example is Figure~\ref{fig:false-alarm}.  In the future, we
plan to enhance the Signedness Checker so it does not issue this false
positive warning by analyzing masks to determine if different signedness shifts
are functionally identical.

We also identified one bug (Figure~\ref{fig:bug}):
unsigned integers are printed by a function that does no special handling
of unsigned values.  Thus, they are printed as
if signed, which leads to erroneous output for values outside the signed
positive range.

Overall, the annotation process took roughly a quarter, though most of this time
was spent understanding the code base and the intention of its developers. Using
the tool was a simple part of this process as it only requires a developer to
apply the \<@Unsigned> annotation where they might specify a type in another language,
then use a modified javac supplied with the tool to compile.
It is our opinion that a full time developer already familiar with the codebase
could accomplish the same result less than a week.


\section{Related Work}

SmartFuzz~\cite{MolnarLW2009} generates tests that are intended to expose
integer bugs, including signed/unsigned conversion.  For each program
execution, it generates and solves a set of contraints that assigns each
integer to a lattice containing Top, Signed, Unsigned, and Bottom.
SmartFuzz incorrectly under-constrains some operations such as x86's
\<IMUL>.  It uses Valgrind to partition integers into union-find sets and
garbage-collects them, an implementation strategy pioneered by
DynComp~\cite{GuoPME2006}.  They report finding 5 likely distinct bugs in C
programs.  As with any testing tool, SmartFuzz gives no guarantee about
future executions.  The same authors' CatchConv tool~\cite{MolnarW2007}
also does run-time type inference, focusing on integer conversion errors
and utilizing symbolic execution.  Our approach is more lightweight and
precise and gives a guarantee, but it requires programmers to write a few
annotations in their code.


\section{Conclusions}

We have developed and implemented a type system, the Signedness Type System, that
captures usage of signed and unsigned
integers in Java programs.
This type system enables developers to detect errors regarding unsigned
integers at compile time and guarantees that such errors cannot occur at
run time.
In a case study our type system proved easy to use and detected a
previously unknown bug.
