\section{Problem and Motivation}

A signed integer uses the first bit of the machine representation to
represent the sign (positive or negative).  An unsigned integer uses all
bits of the machine representation to represent the value.
An unsigned integer can represent a larger range of positive numbers, but
cannot represent negative numbers.
Unsigned integers are useful, so many programming languages support them;
for example, Java 8 provides utility methods for unsigned
integers~\cite{JDK8UnsignedIntegerArithmetic2012}.  However, unsigned
integers are also error-prone:  using an unsigned integer where a signed
one is expected, or performing certain arithmetic operations and
comparisons on unsigned integers, can lead to unexpected results.

We call an operator ``insensitive'' if it produces a correct signed result
when run on two signed values, and it produces a correct unsigned result
when run on two unsigned values.  We call an operator ``sensitive'' if it
produces incorrect results when run on two unsigned values.  For such
operations, a programmer must run a different operator depending on whether
the operands are signed or unsigned.  See Figure~\ref{fig:operators} for
an example of insensitive and sensitive operators.

Misuse of unsigned values can be categorized as follows:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item Using a sensitive operator or routine with operands of opposite signedness to the implementation of the operator.
  \item Mixing signed and unsigned arguments to any operator, sensitive or insensitive.
\end{itemize}

The first line of defense against most bugs is the compiler. When the
compiler is unable to catch bugs it falls on the programmer to identify and
eliminate them, which is prone to human error. The compiler 
is not helpful in finding bugs related to using unsigned
numbers, because Java's unsigned
integers are supported by a library rather than built into Java.


\section{Approach and Uniqueness}

Our approach to detecting and preventing signedness errors is to use a type
system. This has a number of benefits.
%
Compile-time checking permits developers
to catch bugs before they become problems for their end-users.
%
Type systems are a familiar to programmers, who understand how to use them
and how to interpret their warning messages.
%
Type-checking is modular and fast.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
byte x = 255;
byte y = 254;

byte sub = x - y;
// Result is 1, which is correct when:
//  * x, y, and sub are signed.
//  * x, y, and sub are unsigned.

byte div = y / x;
// Result is 2.
//  * Correct for signed x, y, and div.
//  * Incorrect for unsigned x, y, and div.
\end{lstlisting}

    \label{fig:type-hierarchy}
\end{figure}

We have defined a signedness type system with 5 type qualifiers
(Figure~\ref{fig:type-hierarchy}).  Each type qualifier is written together
with a base type; for example, \<@Unsigned int i> declares a
variable named \<i> of type \<@Unsigned int>.

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item \<@Unsigned> signifies that a value is interpreted as unsigned.
  \item \<@Signed> signifies that a value is interpreted as signed.
  \item \<@Constant> is for values known at compile time, such as
    manifest literals in the source code.  The programmer might intend to
    use them as signed or as unsigned values.  Even a negative literal may
    be used as a convenience placeholder for a large positive unsigned
    integer.
  \item \<@UnknownSignedness> indicates a value for which the 
    Signedness Checker has no estimate.  (This usually leads to a
    type-checking warning.)  It is also used for non-numeric
    values, which the Signedness Checker ignores.
  \item \<@SignednessBottom> indicates dead code or the \<null> value.
\end{itemize}

The programmer writes \<@Unsigned> type qualifiers within field and method
declarations in the program's source code.  Unannotated Java types within
field and method signatures are given a default qualifier (usually
\<@Signed>).  Type uses within method bodies are inferred.  More
specifically, here are the type introduction rules of our type system:

\todo{This mixes type introduction rules, which add a qualifier to an
  existing type occurrence (say, in a variable or field declaration), and
  rules that determine the type of an expression.  I think it would be
  helpful to separate these cases.}

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item If the user wrote a type qualifier, use it.
  \item If an integral expression is a constant at compile time, use
    \<@Constant>.
    Integral types are \<char>, \<byte>, \<short>, \<int>, \<long>, \<Integer>, and \<Long>.
  \item If an expression is not a leaf in the syntax tree (i.e. not a
    terminating symbol), its type is the least upper bound of the types in
    the tree rooted on it.\todo{This doesn't make sense to Mike; please
      explain.  Are you talking about operators and \<if>?}
  \item Other integral expressions use \<@Signed>.
  \item Other non-integral expressions use the top type, \<@UnknownSignedness>.
\end{enumerate}

The type rules of the signedness type system issue a warning if a program
might perform a computation using operands of incorrect or mixed signedness.
These type rules are as follows:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item Unsigned values may not be used as operands for sensitive
    operators.
  \item With the exception of shifts, no operator may operate on a mix of
    Signed and Unsigned values.
  \item Logical right shifts may only be applied to unsigned values.
  \item Arithmetic right shifts may only be applied to signed values.
\end{itemize}

An insensitive operator is allowed to be used on either signed or unsigned
values, so long as all the operands are of the same type.  The operator's
result type is the same as its argument types.


\section{Background and Implementation}

% I will go over this section later to include citations. Right now I just want to get words on paper.

Our goal is to build a verification tool that guarantees that software is
free of bugs related to unsigned integers. This means that our approach
must be sound:  if it issues no warnings, then the program must be free of
bugs.
This means that the tool can issue false positive alarms:  warnings about
code that will not actually go wrong at run time.  This occurs when the
Signed Checker cannot prove that the code is correct.\todo{Later, you
  should give concrete examples of false alarms.}

We built our Signedness Checker implementation using the 
Checker Framework~\cite{Ernst2008,DietlDEMS2011}, which enables the
construction of pluggable type systems for Java.

Our pluggable type system implementaion consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item Type qualifiers are implemented declaratively as Java 8 type
    annotations~\cite{JSR308-PFD}.
  \item Type indroduction rules are defined procedurally.
  \item Type rules are enforced by a visitor which visits each node of the syntax tree.
\end{itemize}

The Signedness Checker is distributed as part of the Checker Framework
\url{http://CheckerFramework.org/}, starting with version 2.1.0.


\section{Results and Contributions}
% I will go back through this section and cite where needed

To put the Signedness Checker to the test, we used it to analyze jake2, a Java port of the popular '90s video game, Quake II. This case study is a large, complex piece of software, with many instances of unsigned integers being used in system code. Without applying annotations the Signedness Checker listed many perceived errors with using a logical right shift, sometimes called an unsigned right shift, on signed operands. Many of these were eliminated by annotating documented unsigned integers, but a few persisted. By comparing jake2 with the original C implementation, we have been able to identify and record semantic differences between the two systems, particularly in the usage of right shifts. In detail, the jake2 implementation uses logical right shifts on Signed values in many locations where the C implementation used arithmetic right shifts. It is possible that if a negative value passed to such regions of code that the two implementations will behave differently in a way noticible to the end-user. Further analysis is required to determine if these differences indeed have noticeable effects. Furthermore, we have been able to identify one bug, in which an unsigned integer is passed to a utility function which prints its value during debugging. No special handling of the unsigned value is done, so it is printed as if signed, which can possibly lead to erroneous output for values outside signed positive range.
